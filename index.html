                <p class="h4"><br>Luckily in Victoria, the amount of DUI is not high, around 3% of the car accidents in Victoria 
                during 2015-2019 is due to DUI. Hopefully the number will stay low or even lower.</p>

                    with high amount of car accidents happened during 2015-2019.<br><br> Interestingly, even Melbourn city has the highest amount of
                     car accidents compare to other location in Victoria, the amount of injuries or death is not the highest, whereas Geelong have 
                     >20% less accidents happened compared with Melbourn city, the number of injuryies or death is <span class="text-danger">2 times</span>
                     higher than it.
                     <br><br>
                     Also, <span class="text-warning">Yarra Ranges</span> has a relatively low number of accidents but a high amount of injury or death rate.

                <h4> When we look at which speed zones do most of the accidents happened in. Not suprised that
                    <span class="text-warning">100 km/hr </span>and <span class="text-warning">110 km/hr</span> zone is the top 2 speed zone 
                    where most traffic accidents happened in.
                    <br><br>
                    However, what interesting is the 3rd speed zone where most accident happened in is the <span class="text-warning">20 km/hr</span>
                     speed zone. <br><br>
                     Low-speed accidents may not seem as severe as high-speed collisions, but they still carry the risk of causing serious injuries. Even if a vehicle is traveling at a slow speed, the impact can create enough force to cause significant harm to the occupants inside the car. Some common injuries that can occur in low-speed accidents include whiplash, concussions, and broken bones.
